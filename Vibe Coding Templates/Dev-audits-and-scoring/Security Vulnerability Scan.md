# Security Vulnerability Scan

## Description
This prompt performs a security-focused audit of your code, looking for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, insecure dependencies, and authentication issues. It provides actionable recommendations to secure your application.

## Quick Version
```
Scan this code for security vulnerabilities:

[PASTE CODE]
```

## Max Power Version
```
You are a security engineer specializing in application security. Perform a security audit of the following code, focusing on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

**Code:**
[PASTE CODE OR LINK TO REPO]

Analyze the code and provide a security report with:
1. **Input Validation:** Check for SQL injection, NoSQL injection, and command injection vulnerabilities.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Check if user input is properly sanitized before rendering.
3. **Authentication & Authorization:** Review how users are authenticated and how permissions are checked.
4. **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or passwords.
5. **Insecure Dependencies:** Identify dependencies with known CVEs.
6. **Security Misconfiguration:** Check for insecure defaults or missing security headers.

For each vulnerability found:
- Explain the risk and potential impact.
- Provide a code example showing how to fix it.
- Suggest preventative measures.
```

## Tips
- Run this audit regularly, especially before major releases.
- Use automated tools (like Snyk or npm audit) alongside AI analysis.
- Prioritize fixing high-severity vulnerabilities first.
