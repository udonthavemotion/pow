# Brand Voice Definer

## Description
This prompt helps you define a clear and consistent brand voice for your project. It creates guidelines that ensure all user-facing content—from button labels to error messages—matches your brand's personality and values.

## Quick Version
```
Define a brand voice for my [PROJECT_TYPE]. The personality should be [ADJECTIVES, e.g., "friendly and professional"].
```

## Max Power Version
```
You are a brand strategist. Define a comprehensive brand voice and tone guide for my [PROJECT_TYPE] called [PROJECT_NAME].

**Target Audience:** [DESCRIBE YOUR USERS]
**Brand Personality:** [3-5 ADJECTIVES, e.g., "friendly, professional, helpful, approachable"]
**What We Are:** [WHAT YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE IS]
**What We're Not:** [WHAT YOUR PRODUCT/SERVICE IS NOT]

Create a brand voice guide with:
1. **Voice Overview:** A 2-3 sentence summary of the brand voice.
2. **Tone Variations:** How the tone changes in different contexts (e.g., success messages vs. error messages).
3. **Do's and Don'ts:** Specific examples of phrases to use and avoid.
4. **Example Rewrites:** Take these generic phrases and rewrite them in the brand voice:
   - "An error occurred."
   - "Click here to continue."
   - "Welcome to our platform."
   - "Are you sure you want to delete this?"
```

## Tips
- Be specific about your target audience—voice changes based on who you're talking to.
- Use the "What We're Not" section to clarify boundaries (e.g., "We're not corporate or stuffy").
- Apply this voice consistently across all user-facing text.
