# Boilerplate Generator

## Description
This prompt generates boilerplate code for common patterns, saving you from writing repetitive setup code. It's perfect for starting new projects, creating new API endpoints, or setting up standard file structures.

## Quick Version
```
Generate boilerplate code for a [PATTERN, e.g., "REST API endpoint"] in [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK].
```

## Max Power Version
```
You are an expert in [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]. Generate production-ready boilerplate code for a [PATTERN].

**Requirements:**
- Follow [FRAMEWORK] best practices and conventions.
- Include proper error handling.
- Add TypeScript types (if applicable).
- Include comments explaining the structure.
- Make it easy to extend and customize.

**Specific Pattern:** [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU NEED, e.g., "Express.js REST API with CRUD operations"]

Provide:
1. The complete, copy-paste-ready code.
2. File structure (if multiple files).
3. Any dependencies that need to be installed.
4. Brief usage instructions.
```

## Example Usage

**To generate a Next.js API route:**

"You are an expert in Next.js. Generate production-ready boilerplate code for an API route.

**Specific Pattern:** A Next.js 13 API route that handles GET and POST requests with proper error handling and TypeScript types."

## Tips
- Customize the generated boilerplate to match your project's conventions.
- Save commonly used boilerplate as snippets in your editor.
- Use this to maintain consistency across your codebase.
