# Vibe Coding Templates

**A comprehensive prompt library for AI-powered development with Claude, ChatGPT, and other LLMs**

## Overview

Welcome to the **Vibe Coding Templates** library—your complete toolkit for building better software faster with AI assistance. This collection contains over 30 battle-tested prompt templates organized into 11 categories, covering everything from brainstorming to deployment.

These prompts are designed to be **tech-stack agnostic**, **copy-paste ready**, and **beginner-friendly**, while still providing the depth and structure needed for production-quality code.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is a modern development approach that combines human creativity and intuition with AI capabilities. It's not about replacing traditional software engineering—it's about augmenting it. Vibe coding lets you:

- **Ship faster** by letting AI handle boilerplate and repetitive tasks
- **Focus on the vibe** of your product while AI handles implementation details
- **Iterate quickly** with tight feedback loops and stepwise refinement
- **Learn continuously** by seeing how AI approaches problems

## How to Use This Library

### Getting Started

1. **Browse the categories** to find prompts relevant to your current task
2. **Open a prompt template** and read the description to understand when to use it
3. **Choose a version:**
   - **Quick Version:** For fast iterations and simple tasks
   - **Max Power Version:** For complex features requiring detailed specifications
4. **Fill in the placeholders** (marked with `[BRACKETS]`) with your specific details
5. **Copy and paste** the prompt into Claude, ChatGPT, or your preferred AI assistant

### Best Practices

**Start with Meta Prompts**
Begin each session by setting up your AI assistant with the "AI Pair Programmer Role" and "Guardrail Prompt" to establish a collaborative, safe working environment.

**Provide Context**
The more context you provide about your project, tech stack, and goals, the better the AI's responses will be. Consider creating a project context document you can reference in prompts.

**Iterate Stepwise**
For complex features, use the stepwise approach: break tasks into small steps, confirm each step before moving to the next. This prevents hallucinations and ensures quality.

**Combine Prompts**
Many prompts work well together. For example, use "Brain Dump to Feature Checklist" followed by "Component/Feature Builder" to go from idea to implementation.

**Customize for Your Needs**
These templates are starting points. Modify them to match your team's conventions, preferred frameworks, and specific requirements.

**Learn from the AI**
Use prompts like "Root Cause Analysis" and "Prompt Optimizer" to learn better development practices and improve your prompting skills over time.

## Prompt Design Principles

Every prompt in this library follows these core principles:

1. **Clear Role Definition:** Specifies the AI's expertise level and behavior
2. **Explicit Constraints:** Defines boundaries, format, and requirements
3. **Actionable Output:** Specifies the desired format (bullets, code blocks, sections)
4. **Tech-Stack Agnostic:** Uses placeholders like `[FRAMEWORK]` and `[LANGUAGE]`
5. **Beginner-Friendly:** Written in clear, accessible language with explanations
6. **Two-Tier Complexity:** Quick version for speed, Max Power for thoroughness
7. **Context-Aware:** Encourages providing relevant background information
8. **Iterative-Friendly:** Supports stepwise refinement and feedback loops
9. **Quality-Focused:** Emphasizes maintainability, security, and best practices
10. **Reusable:** No hardcoded project-specific details

## Compatible AI Tools

These prompts work with any chat-based LLM, including:

- **Claude** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus)
- **ChatGPT** (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo)
- **Gemini** (Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra)
- **AI-powered IDEs** (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot Chat)
- **Other LLMs** that support conversational prompting
