# Design System Generator

## Description
This prompt generates a mini design system with reusable UI components like buttons, inputs, and cards. It helps you establish visual consistency from the start without needing to design every component from scratch.

## Quick Version
```
Generate a mini UI kit using [FRAMEWORK, e.g., "Tailwind CSS"]. Include buttons, inputs, and cards.
```

## Max Power Version
```
You are a UI/UX designer specializing in design systems. Create a mini design system for a [PROJECT_TYPE] using [STYLING_FRAMEWORK].

Generate reusable components for:
1. **Buttons:** Primary, secondary, and danger variants with hover states.
2. **Input Fields:** Text input, textarea, and select dropdown with focus states.
3. **Cards:** A card component with header, body, and footer sections.
4. **Typography:** Heading styles (H1-H4) and body text.
5. **Spacing:** A consistent spacing scale.

For each component:
- Provide the complete, copy-paste-ready code.
- Use a consistent naming convention.
- Ensure components are accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
- Keep the design clean and minimal.

The visual style should be [STYLE, e.g., "modern and professional", "playful and colorful"].
```

## Tips
- Specify your styling framework (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, plain CSS) for appropriate syntax.
- Customize the generated components to match your brand identity.
- Use this as a foundation and add more components as needed.
