# Cursor AI Rules - Design Preferences

## 🚫 NO TRANSPARENT BOXED CARDS

**CRITICAL DESIGN RULE:** Never create transparent, boxed card components with glassmorphism effects.

### What to Avoid:
- Transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur (`bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm`, `bg-black/20 backdrop-blur-md`)
- Rounded containers with borders (`rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl` with `border border-white/20`)
- Glassmorphism effects that create "floating card" appearance
- Boxed containers that encapsulate content in transparent squares/rectangles

### What to Do Instead:
- Content sits directly on the background (flat design)
- Use drop shadows (`drop-shadow-lg`, `drop-shadow-2xl`) for text visibility
- Use spacing and typography hierarchy instead of containers
- Let background gradients/patterns show through naturally

### Examples:

**❌ BAD:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-xl p-6 border border-white/20">
  <h3>Title</h3>
</div>
```

**✅ GOOD:**
```tsx
<div className="text-center">
  <h3 className="text-white drop-shadow-2xl mb-4">Title</h3>
  <p className="text-white/90 drop-shadow-lg">Content</p>
</div>
```

### When Transparency IS Acceptable:
- Overlays on images/videos (gradient overlays)
- Modal backdrops (`bg-black/95` for modals)
- Navigation bars with backdrop blur (when appropriate)
- Background decorative elements (blurred orbs, gradients)

### When Transparency is NOT Acceptable:
- Content containers/cards
- Stats displays
- Feature boxes
- Testimonial cards
- Any component that creates a "floating box" appearance

**Design Philosophy:** Prefer flat, integrated designs where content blends with the background rather than being contained in boxes.
